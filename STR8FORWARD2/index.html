        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: What Is The Name Of It</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: That Song</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: Haven't thought of one.</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: So You Were Improvising</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: You could say it's a very long improvisational piece, with lots of very large gaps in between.</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: When I first started playing, my father gave me the first book of beginner viola songs he could find on his way home from work, but I found the compositions therein to not be very interesting.</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: You Wrote Your Own</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: No, I scratched at the stupid thing like a cat trying to slit a chalkboard's throat until I heard something I liked. Little by little, years went by, and I'd always default to it as a warmup or a gap-filler. It's grown a lot, and happened to stop sounding terrible somewhere along the way, which is a plus.</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: I See</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: From Where Im Sitting That Does Appear To 8e Your General Way Of Going A8out Life</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: Someone Sets Up A Nice Little Task Or Set Of Guidelines To Follow Only For You To Scratch And 8ite At The Very Gesture</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: Its Maddening</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: I Had Hoped Humankind Might Have Produced Less Petulant Specimens</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: Sorry to disappoint.</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: Do You H8 Your Father Lusus That Much</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: Did I say I hated him?</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: You Didnt Like His 8ook</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: I didn't like the pieces *in* the book.</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: Father and I might not see eye to eye on things all the time, but I don't hate him.</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: I'm fascinated at the fact you came to that conclusion, though.</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: Is Your World So 8lack And White</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: Dont Do That</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: Do What</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: That</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: Its Fucking Rude</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: I Am Trying To Help You</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: Really? Elaborate, because I missed that part. I'm very stupid, you see, and I need a smart troll to explain what she means when she says things before I can understand.</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: Well At Least Youre Self Aware</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: (Lol.)</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: To 8e Str8forward You Are Playing Like A Manic Completionist</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: This Game Has Tasks And Roles And Things It Demands Of Its Players And You Are Achieving Very Few Of Them In A Timely Manner</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: I Can Already See You Doing What We Just Talked A8out And Throwing Away Your Chances Of Victory For Some Personal Spiteful Vindic8ion From Not Doing What Youre Told</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: Hence Me 8eing Here Now</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: Telling You To Not Do That</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: I see.</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: Well, too bad. You were in the right ball-park: I'm the type that likes to take my time with games, sidequesting and secret-hunting and such.</span> <br>
        <span class="kanaya" style="color: #005682">GA: In The Game That Kills You</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: Even in the game that kills you, yes.</span> <br>
        <span class="rose" style="color: #0715cd">EB: Didn't you already figure out I'm allergic to backseating? You seem to think yourself an expert on me.</span> <br>
