            <b>-- <span class="meteoroidMatador" style="color: #C13C25">meteoroidMatador [MM]</span> began pestering <span class="xenoXtractor" style="color: #4373E5">xenoXtractor [XX]</span> -- <br>
            <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: so they found the meteor guy</span> <br>
             <span class="xenoXtractor" style="color: #4373e5">XX: Oh, yeah?</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: yeah some dude was documenting him on video and putting it up on these podunk boards cause he went total doomsday prophet about it</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: EB just posted them to the forum thats how I found out</span> <br>
             <span class="xenoXtractor" style="color: #4373e5">XX: EB is a lunatic.</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: yeah but she's got weirdly good intel on weird internet shit</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: in the video he's like, talking shit about sburb and how it's connected to the meteor and then he gets honest to god like</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: men in black'd</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: like they look like mini-mall cops or whatever but they put him in a car and drove off and this was 2 days ago, he's not been back to where he was staying since</span> <br>
             <span class="xenoXtractor" style="color: #4373e5">XX: That sounds fake as fuck, he probably just got arrested for public disturbance and went to a different hotel or relative the day after.</span> <br>
             <span class="xenoXtractor" style="color: #4373e5">XX: Also there's no way EB is actually a 13 year old girl. Probably just a weirdo with a fetish or some unworked trauma or whatever.</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: so a fetish</span> <br>
             <span class="xenoXtractor" style="color: #4373e5">XX: Yeah I guess, haha.</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: i mean to be fair the internet isn't exactly hard for kids to access</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: and weren't you one of those autistic kids that was super verbose in elementary school and everyone made fun of you for it</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: you'd probably be on forums talking smack too if you'd had a laptop and five seconds away from Lego Star Wars 2</span> <br>
             <span class="xenoXtractor" style="color: #4373e5">XX: Alright man, whatever. I'm watching the video.</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: see what gets me is that, according to the stalker dude, meteor guy was staying with his uncle after the meteor hit</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: stalker dude lives in the area and caught him moving in so he snapped a pic for clout etc. etc.</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: so like, did he just leave all that shit there or</span> <br>
             <span class="xenoXtractor" style="color: #4373e5">XX: Okay yeah, that was pretty fucked. That's not... Normal screaming.</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: that shit curdled my milk</span> <br>
             <span class="xenoXtractor" style="color: #4373e5">XX: If that's him acting, he's wasting his talents lol. I'd say he's more likely actually off his shit.</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: if you got a copy of a game a week and some change early then your fuckin house gets blown up by a space rock would you also start screaming about how video games are evil y/n</span> <br>
             <span class="xenoXtractor" style="color: #4373e5">XX: I mean, no. That'd be stupid. But I understand how someone else might freak out in that scenario.</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: lmao</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: well at least if my house gets blown up next week and i die, you'll be able to avenge me</span> <br>
             <span class="xenoXtractor" style="color: #4373e5">XX: You're actually playing it? I thought that shit was like, The Sims.</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: you don't fw the sims?</span> <br>
             <span class="xenoXtractor" style="color: #4373e5">XX: Not enough to pay full price when emulators exist.</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: im hopping on with TO and BP</span> <br>
             <span class="xenoXtractor" style="color: #4373e5">XX: Have fun. Don't die lol.</span> <br>
             <span class="meteroidMatador" style="color: #c13c25">MM: lol</span> <br>
